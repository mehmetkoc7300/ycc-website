All work is remote, but you are expected to have a dependable internet connection with a computer of your own during the training. In future, we might want to see you in person just to have fun together like any great team does, but work will always be remote for us.</p>

                <div class="answer-div">
                    <p>This is a program for students or fresh graduates so we obviously do not look for “previous job experience” but it is a very important advantage if you have a personal code repo / pet project you can explain to us. We look for candidates who are dirty handed with code. Your passion and the amount of personal effort you have put into coding is what matters here, not your “experience”.</p>
